# Guess the Word
by Lucy Brock

Creates a battlegame between a player and a monster. 

## What this application does:
This program creates a player and a monster by reading from the .txt files in this folder. The app allows the user (as the player) to attack or cast spells on the monster. The monster then attacks the player. The app displays the monster and player's health at after each attack, ending the game when one is dead (has health <=0), or the user enters quit. 

## What technologies/techniques it uses:
Random generator, classes, loops, conditionals, command-line inputs, reading/writing to files. 

## Challenges and future implementations:
I need to update the spells class. Ultimately this game could be transferred to a server and run with simple graphics.  

## Installation
This app runs on any system that supports java code.

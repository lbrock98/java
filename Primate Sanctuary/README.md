# Primate Sanctuary
by Lucy Brock

Creates a battlegame between a player and a monster. 

## Overview
This program gives a framework for a sanctuary for animals. Currently, it is used to house primates in either isolation cages or enclosures.

## Features 
The program can create monkeys, update their attributes in a medical check, assign them to housing, look up where a certain species is housed, 
produce a shopping list of the monkeys’ favorite foods, produce a sign for each enclosure telling the user about each monkey, and add enclosures or 
isolation cages if needed and if the sanctuary’s funds permit this. More animals could be added as classes to this program. 

## Use
Commands to introduce a new monkey to the sanctuary, create a sign for a sanctuary, send a monkey for a medical update, get a list of the animals and 
where they’re housed, get a list of the species and where they’re housed, lookup a certain species and where it’s housed, create a shopping list for 
the sanctuary, and rehouse an animal are all called manually. The program will automatically update a monkey and housing unit’s information if a monkey 
is sent for a medical check or moves housing. It will also automatically add housing units, if they prove necessary and the funds are available.
